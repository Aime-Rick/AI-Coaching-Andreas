## 📈 Monitoring & Testing

### Check Performance Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/performance
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "cache": {
    "total_entries": X,
    "active_entries": X,
    "hits": X,
    "misses": X,
    "hit_rate": "XX.XX%",
    "total_requests": X
  },
  "time": TIMESTAMP
}
```

### Target Metrics
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >70% (Good), >80% (Great), >90% (Excellent)
- **Page Load**: <2 seconds
- **API Response**: <1 second for most operations
- **Chat Response**: <6 seconds

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Restart backend service (to apply all changes)
2. ✅ Restart frontend service
3. ✅ Test file operations speed
4. ✅ Monitor cache statistics
5. ✅ Check for any errors in logs

### Testing
```bash
# Test backend
curl http://localhost:8000/performance

# Test file listing
curl http://localhost:8000/files

# Check database indexes
sqlite3 ai_coaching.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='index';"
```

### Ongoing
- Monitor `/performance` endpoint regularly
- Track cache hit rates
- Watch for slow request warnings
- Optimize further based on usage patterns

---

## 🛠️ Configuration Tuning

### If Memory is Limited
Reduce cache TTL in `backend/cache.py`:
```python
cache_manager = CacheManager(default_ttl=180)  # 3 minutes
```

### If Database is Slow
Increase connection pool in `backend/database/connection.py`:
```python
pool_size=20,
max_overflow=40,
```

### If API Calls are Timing Out
Increase timeouts in `frontend/client/src/lib/api.ts`:
```typescript
const timeout = options?.timeout || 60000;  // 60 seconds
```
